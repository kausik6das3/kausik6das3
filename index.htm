<h2> Biography</h2>
<hr>
<!--p>Kausik Das, better known as Kd to his pals, was born in March 10, 1992 but due to some weird reasons he doesn’t celebrate his birthday on this very day. After fooling around his family, schools, college, institute, job, research and finally last but not the least with himself he is now completely jobless. He is a computer, technology and sound enthusiast . He really endorse GNU/Linux operating system and admire "Free and Opensource Software". He often talk about parallel programming, how you should check scalability of it and run it in a efficient way that kind of stuffs all though he doesn’t have any idea about it at all. When it comes to share a H.P.C (High Performance Computer) he prefer freedom over strict rules of some job submit software. He strongly believe that community can talk to each other and and run there jobs efficiently. He feel his deep passion for music all though he don’t has any musical talent. he talk about auto tune, program instrument, etc got into records these days and distorting music. During COVID-19 pandemic he basically stayed at home and fulling around his future he maid this website. Basically he is an idiot so don’t take him seriously.</-->

<p>
Kausik Das, better known as Kd to his pals, was born in March 10, 1992 in a very small village which doesn't recognise to almost any one. As a child he love to play and paint but eventually become an university degree holder in Physics. During his study he got passionate about computer and shelf learn various programming language and eventually end up taking various research position regarding it. He is very much interested in parallel programming. 

He has much interest in music and love to collect music albums but cannot stand any pitch correction at all which end up winding most of popular records these days. He famously says his ear hearts hearing auto tune.

During is graduation he also fall for photography. As a result end up buying a camcorder and end us taking lot of pictures. But as any one can imagine he didn't get too far. Even now a days he took picture now and then but nothing spectacular. PS he didn't own any DSLR.

 During COVID-19 pandemic he basically stayed at home and maid this website from scratch .

		<h4><b>Theoretical Investigation of Magnetism at Different Length Scales.</b></h4>
		<h4>Project Assistant.</h4>
    		<p> Understanding the static and dynamic properties of a magnet at mesoscopic scale is necessary for
the applications of magnets in various magneto-electronics devices, non-volatile memory devices
and magnetic sensors. The magnetisation reversal and coercive mechanism for such magnets
are studied statistically using Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert equation in presence of exchange defects
and anisotropy. Threshold fields for nucleation and domain wall propagation are estimated. The
effect of pinning and nucleation mechanism in presence of defects are being observed. The effect
of dipolar interaction and temperature in such processes are explored theoretically.</p>

in solitons is observed. Also linear stability of these solitons have been investigated.</p>

    		<p> X-ray reflectivity (XRR) is a well-established, powerful tool for measuring properties of thin
films. This project outlines XRR and its properties in thin films using mathematical tools to
simulate an outcome with given conditions. The condition variables are roughness (σ) , thickness
(d), density(ρ). Further the number of layers is also an important variable consider. Also Non-
linear Least-squares method use to extract out the condonation variables from an experimental
XRR data of an organic multilayer thin film.</p>
